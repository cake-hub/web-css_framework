# Pagination

Documentation and examples for showing pagination to indicate a series of related content exists across multiple pages.

## Overview

We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss and easily scalableâ€”all while providing large hit areas. Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links. Use a wrapping `<nav>` element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

In addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it's advisable to provide a descriptive `aria-label` for the `<nav>` to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be `aria-label="Search results pages"`.

## Working with icons

Looking to use an icon or symbol in place of text for some pagination links? Be sure to provide proper screen reader support with `aria` attributes and use a proper `title` tag for svg-icons.

            "type": "link"
        },
        "<html>":{
            "src": "examples/PaginationDefault.html",

            "selector": "#app"
        }
    '
 />

## Different variants

You can also show paginations with more or less than five items. For example you can only show the arrow-items or add more than three page-links.

<ContentRack
    fields='
        "preview": {
            "src": "examples/PaginationVariants.html",
            "type": "link"
        },
        "<html>":{
            "src": "examples/PaginationVariants.html",
            "type": "content",
            "selector": "#app"
        }
    '
 />

## Disabled and active states

Pagination links are customizable for different circumstances. Use `.disabled` for links that appear un-clickable and `.active` to indicate the current page.

While the `.disabled` class uses `pointer-events: none` to _try_ to disable the link functionality of `<a>`s, that CSS property is not yet standardized and doesn't account for keyboard navigation. As such, you should always add `tabindex="-1"` on disabled links and use custom JavaScript to fully disable their functionality.

<ContentRack
    fields='
        "preview": {
            "src": "examples/PaginationDisabledActiveState.html",
            "type": "link"
        },
        "<html>":{
            "src": "examples/PaginationDisabledActiveState.html",
            "type": "content",
            "selector": "#app"
        }
    '
 />

You can optionally swap out active or disabled anchors for `<span>`, or omit the anchor in the case of the prev/next arrows, to remove click functionality and prevent keyboard focus while retaining intended styles.

### Pagination with span instead of link for disabled and active states
